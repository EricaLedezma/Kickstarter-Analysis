# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of this analysis is to see how other Kickstarter campaigns in the "play" subcategory fared in relation to the launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

In the Outcomes Based on Goal analysis, there was a small dataset that proved that a campaign with a larger goal amount ($35,000-$45,000) could be successful. However, the dataset was less than 10 campaigns (<1% of total number of campaigns).

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

 1. We found that a campaign that lauched in May had the highest rate of success, followed by the month of June. 

 2. The month of December had the lowest rate of success for a campaign launch. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  - We found that the campaigns with a goal of less than $1000 had the highest percentage of success. The higher the goal amount, the more likely it was to fail. The lower the goal amount, the more likely it was to be successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - The dataset was limited to the subcategory "plays" and a kickstarters success rate in relation to the month it launched and the goal amount.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  - We could compare these findings to other subcategories and see if they align or differ. 
  - We could anaylyze the duration of the "play" campaigns to see if that had an effect on success or failure rate. 
  - We could analyze the effect geography may have. Which countries are campaigns more successful? Which countries is a campaign more likely to fail?
